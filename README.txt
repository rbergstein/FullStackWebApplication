To log into the website, you will need to use the following username and password, as it is the only account in the database.

- username: pickles
- password: dill

[Disclaimer: After the class this project was built for came to an end, the Google Maps API key was deactivated and as a result the route finding and navigation map features no longer work (as a new API key would require a paid subscription)]
